hansoft-svn
===========

hansoft-svn is a suite for svn integration into Hansoft.
The integration consists of three seperate parts. Each part can either run on its own machine, or all three parts could run on the same machine depending on what the infrastructure looks like.

The three parts of hansoft-svn are the following, please refer to each one of them for more information on how to use and install them:
