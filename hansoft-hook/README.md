Hansoft-hook
============

Hansoft-hook consists of 2 parts, oa client and a server. 
The client is invoked by a hook script from subversion. 
The server is intended to run independently and listen to input from the integration server. 

Make sure that both the server and the client is running from the subversion group.
Both programs need to run on the subversion server.
